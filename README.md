# Matplotlib_Challenge


Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

I have been tasked with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study and providing a top-level summary of the study results.


First, I prepared the data by removing the duplicate mouse data (g989).

Next, generated summary statistics that includes a row for each drug regimen and a column for each of the following statistics: mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume.

Then, I created a bar charts and pie charts showing the total number of rows and to show the distribution of female versus male mice in the study.

Next, I calculated the quartitles to find outliers, which is represented in the Box Plot.

Finally, I created a line plot of mouse I509 to show the tumor volume versus point in time (via days) and a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin regimen; adding the linear regression model.

Analysis:

Capomulin and Ramicane are more effective in reducing the size of tumors than Infubinol and Ceftamine; with Infubinol having 1 outlier.

We should note that both Capomulin and Ramicane were used more during the testing than the other drugs during the study.

When looking at the linear regression, weight has a strong positive correlation (84%) when compared to average Tumor volume. We can concluded that the heavier the mouse, the larger the volume of the tumor.
